# Welcome
Welcome to the aperture command line enrichment interface.

## How to get hold of the portalgun.sh
You need to `source portalgun.sh`, in order to be able
to use it. Once you hold the portalgun.sh you can either
shoot `blue` (or `orange`) portals at your current
location or aim it somewhere else as in `blue somedir`
(or `orange somedir`).

You can remove either portal with `rmblue` or `rmorange`.
and jump through portals with `jump` (as in `jump orange_portal`).
The jump command is just a fancier `cd`, with some extra
stuff like helping reorient you after the spatial confusion
inflicted by teleportation.

The participant should remember that while the portals
are persistent, the knowledge of the location of the
portals are not, so at the end of each test the
participant would do well to remove any and all open portals
to avoid unnecesary side effects.

## Caveat Emptor
The aperture command line enrichment interface testing
and monitoring department would like you to know that
related and/or unrelated effects such as, but not limited
to, temporal instability, impromptu games of exploding
musical chairs, irreversible loss of data, file system
corruption, and/or coffee supply depletion, are all to be
considered and logged as part of the test. If the subject,
or the subject's boss, consider any such and other effects
to be unacceptable, the aperture command line enrichment
interface and monitoring department would like to remind
you that participation in the test is entirely optional,
and that it is perfectly fine to run away if you are scared.
